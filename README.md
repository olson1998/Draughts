# Draughts

<br>Old java project</br>
<br>Console app which functionality is plaing round of Checkers</br>
<br>How the game works:</br>
<br>The base theory is that the board is big 8x8 array with consecutive numbers so the diagonally located numbers create arithmetic sequences wir r = +/- 9 and +/-9  <br>
<br>So the software counts following expressins and compere their locations on map</br>
